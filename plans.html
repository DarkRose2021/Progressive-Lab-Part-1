                    Something I plan to do is get a job that I enjoy, have a horse farm, and live with my S/O (if I have one at the time). 
                    With this college I plan to go into a job that I'll enjoy and hopefully after some years work from home or have my own little 
                    business. Since I grew up with horses, I want to continue owning them, plus riding horses is something I love to do. I want to 
                    live with my S/O because I want to be around the people that I love, plus I'll be able to teach them about horses, if they don't 
                    know already.

                    What's going to be most important to me is that I end up doing something I love and I won't regret my choices or my life.
                    I want to have horses and that will never change about my future plans and it's not something I'm willing to easily let go 
                    of having. I know that I won't be able to have horses right out of college, but as soon as I can I'm going to have my farm.
