                <h2>Growing Up</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in southern Kentucky with some horses. We didn't 
                    really have many neighbors or many cars go by our house. 
                    I learned how to ride horses pretty early in my life. About 4
                    years ago I got my first horse. She was a <em>handful</em> at first, 
                    but now she a great horse to let kids learn to ride on. Even 
                    though she's a calm horse, once she enters an area, she's a 
                    <strong>different</strong> horse.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Since I grew up kind of in the middle of nowhere, I couldn't 
                    really do much at home. Up until 7th grade I went to T.C.Cherry
                    and Bowling Green Middle School. I couldn't have a lot of my friends
                    come over to my house because their parents didn't want their children
                    so far from town. I switched to JEBMS, which was in Allen County, And I 
                    never really hung out with people after school becauseI had to take the bus
                    home and my friends didn't really live near me. Making friends and hanging out 
                    with them outside of school is hard for me.
